<h2>Hostels</h1>
<p>NSUT's hostels provide a wide range of facilities to ensure that students enjoy a vibrant campus life, while simultaneously accommodating a large number of students. A total of four hostel buildings (BH1, BH2, BH3, BH4) are present for male students, one for each year. There are two girls’ hostels (GH). Each hostel is well maintained with staff working overtime to ensure that students live comfortably inside the building premises. The hostel buildings are located close to the canteens as well as the administrative block (where classes ensue). Mess food is nutritious with a different menu for each day of the week.
</p>
<p>Additionally, each boys' hostel has the capacity to accommodate up to 276 students in single & double-bedded rooms. Students are allotted rooms on the basis of their permanent addresses & sorted distance wise. The outside Delhi candidates are thus given top priority. However, most students who apply for a hostel room are able to get one as soon as possible.
</p>
<p>
Each hostel has its own in-premises mess. The hostels have 24 hours water supply & power backup available. A parking lot is located outside each hostel for the convenience of students.

<h2>Security</h1>

<p>The hostels have their separate committees and are under the guidance of their respective wardens. With proper 24*7 securities, including lady guards in the girls’ hostel, students are sound & safe in the already calm, green campus. The hostels ensure that curfew times are adhered to adequately as security is a must for each building.
</p>
<h2>Facilities</h1>

<p>A common room with television is provided for the entertainment of students. Facilities for playing carom & chess are also available. A badminton court & TT rooms ensure that hostellers keep in touch with sports of their interest. Movies or sports matches can be projected on a large screen as per the choice of students. Availability of daily newspapers is an added luxury. On request, personal newspapers & magazines can be delivered on payment. In the first year boys’ hostel, students also avail the facility of laundry on a payment basis. Washing machines are available & their use can be approved by the hostel office staff on designated days. The presence of a shopping complex, which provides all the basic amenities within walking distance, is a convenience. The metro station is at a walking distance from all the hostels. Guest rooms are available for male guests & mothers to stay overnight in the boys hostel. A newly introduced Wi-Fi connection is present in the girls’ hostel. The same is available for use on weekdays from 8-11 pm and for the entire day during the weekend.</p>

<h1>Hostel Events</h1>

<p>Students from all over the country join NSUT, and for these students, NSUT's hostels eventually become their second homes. Various events take place in the hostels to give them the feel of home. Ramanujan Hostel, made especially for first year students joining NSUT, leaves no stone unturned in doing so. Small celebrations take place all through the academic year, beginning with ‘Vanmahotsav’, where the students along with the warden of the hostel plant trees in the college campus. ‘Spardha’, the sports fest of the hostel, witnesses students residing in the four hostel blocks compete against each other in various outdoor & indoor sports to win the best block award. The celebrations are brought to a close with ‘Milan’, where students doing incredibly well in maths are awarded with the prestigious Ramanujan Award. Milan also witnesses well established & successful alumni come back to college and share a few words of wisdom. After some cultural performances, a special dinner is served to the students. All these events take place to celebrate the spirit of opportunity & joy.</p>

<p>NSUT's hostels provide the students with all the facilities that could make these four important years of their lives as pleasant as possible. The hostels not only serve as a place toreside in, but they play a vital role in the personality development of students while living an independent life away from their guardians.</p>
